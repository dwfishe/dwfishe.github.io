I've worked in banking for over 10 years, but I've wanted to be a part of the tech industry for a long time, so I'm taking the dive! Right now, on top of learning more about Github and Jekyll, I'm also taking online classes to teach myself Python. I've always loved digging into problems and trying to find a solution. I've had somewhat of an outlet for this at my current job by finding ways to communicate data in reporting through my Excel models, but there are so many more possibilities with coding. I'm loving all that I'm learning right now!
